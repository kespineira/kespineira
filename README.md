### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am passionate about systems administration. Very focused on the automation of processes, monitoring of systems and the deployment of solutions in Cloud (AWS and Azure). In all these processes I prioritize the use of containers with Docker and Kubernetes

I currently have the LPIC-1 and studying the LPIC-2.
